One approach that helped make these things possible was the \u0000exibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\nCyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing exibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno, director of marketing  believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\n\nMoreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to beer understand how annual members and casual riders dier, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# ASK\nBussiness Task: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Prepare\n**1.
